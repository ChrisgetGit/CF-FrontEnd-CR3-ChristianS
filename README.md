For this CodeReview, the following criteria will be graded:

    (05 points) Correct usage of the HTML structure (proper order of HTML elements).

    (05 points) Correct code structure (aka code indentation) for the HTML and Javascript code.

    (05 points) Clear separation of CSS, JavaScript and images in distinct folders: css, js, img (access through relative paths).

    (20 points) Correct CSS styling according to the provided design (colours, layout, fonts etc. Pay attention to the small details like shadows, rounded corners, etc.). Feel free to improve the design if you want.

    (10 points) Create at least one media query to make the webpage responsive.

    (20 points) Create a function calculateInsurance(). This function does a calculation with a formula based on the selected country:

        For Austria : insurance = horse_power x 100 / age   + 50;

        For Hungary: insurance = horse_power x 120 / age  + 100;

        For Greece: insurance = horse_power x 150 / (age+3)  + 50;


    (15 points) You should be able to use the values from the input fields and use them as calculation values for calculateInsurance() function. (hint: pay attention to data-type conversion!)

    (15 points) Use these calculated values to present the insurance price on the screen where "printed calculation goes here" is placed (see image example). e.g. “John, your insurance costs 300 €”


Bonus Points:

    (10 points) Display the employees within the team.html, an extra page you should provide with your own design, outputting the data from an external JSON file which you shall as well create separately. A JSON file can be stored together to the other JS files. See information below.

    (10 points) Add more information to the objects (i.e more information other than name, email and image). When a member is clicked on (for example, Bill), then more information should be displayed about this specific member(i.e. Bill in this example).
